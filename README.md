## Inbound-Outbound Voice Calls Twilio Application
This project consists of two servlets that handle inbound and outbound voice calls using the Twilio API.

## Features
Receive Servlet:
Handles incoming voice calls and responds with a TwiML XML.
When a call is received, it retrieves relevant information (e.g., message content) from the database or other sources.
Generates a TwiML response (XML format) containing the appropriate voice message or instructions.
OutboundCall Servlet:
Initiates outbound voice calls to specified phone numbers.
Logs call details, such as call SID and timestamps.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK)
Apache Tomcat or any other JSP/Servlet container
Twilio Account SID and Auth Token
## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Import the project into your favorite IDE (e.g., NetBeans, Eclipse).
Add the Twilio Java helper library to your project dependencies.
Configuration
Set your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token in the OutboundCall servlet.
Update the phone numbers (e.g., toPhoneNumber and fromPhoneNumber) with the desired values.
## Usage
Deploy the application to your servlet container.
The Receive servlet will be triggered by Twilio when an inbound voice call is received.
The OutboundCall servlet can be triggered by making a POST request with the necessary parameters (e.g., toPhoneNumber and message).
